Personal Portfolio Website

Built using JS-based MEAN stack. (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS).

Contains:
1. Sample websites I have created
2. A link to my blog

Creation Chronology:
1. conFusion was the first website I ever made. Part of an HKUST course.
2. Phoenix was the second website. Just for fun.
3. The github webpage (jean13.github.io) was my third. Just for fun.
4. The Tokugawa was my fourth website. 
5. 

Purpose of building website is to practice. As a nice extra I can also display my work.

Work in constant progress.
